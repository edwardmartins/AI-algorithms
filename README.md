# AI algorithms

## A star algorithm
A-star is one of the most successful search algorithms to find the shortest path between nodes. It is an informed search algorithm, as it uses information about path cost and also uses heuristics to find the solution.

## ID3 algorithm
In decision tree learning, ID3 is an algorithm used to generate a decision tree from a dataset. ID3 is typically used in the machine learning and natural language processing domains.

## K-Means 
K-Means is one of the simplest unsupervised learning algorithms that solves the clustering problem. It groups all the objects in such a way that objects in the same group (group is a cluster) are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other groups
